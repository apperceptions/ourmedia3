#summary One-sentence summary of this page.
Good Morning Mr. Lasica!  I am one of Marie Drennan's students at SF
State.  I created my own account on your ourmedia website, and was
able to explore some of the things that your site had to offer.  After
searching your site, I have found it to be full great features.  One
of the things that I enjoyed was the fact that your site has a whole
bunch of videos that many can benefit from.  I also enjoyed the layout
of the site and found it very easy to navigate.  There was one problem
that I did encounter.  I was unable to create my own channel.  I know
that it was one of the things that you wanted us to do, but every time
I tried to create one, it would lead me to a page with a message that
said I was not authorized to do so.  Other than that, I feel that you
have a great website on your hands.
