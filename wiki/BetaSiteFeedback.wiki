1- *Notifications Need Empahsis*-
example: the one that says "Thank you for applying for an account..." notification should be in *RED* or have a diff. color background, the plain black blends in too much 'The changes have been saved.'

2- *Cause Tab in Profile Editing Section Needs Tweaks*-
i think it should be defined fields, like Cause Name:    Cause Link:
and maybe specify that you can link to outside places? i was a little confused on that would be a great place to learn about causes people care about. also we should define 'cause' i automatically think of it as a non-profit, but it could (potentially) be a lot of things. also would be cool to have a little sidebar check box option to put your Fav. Causes on your profile sidebar.

3- *Terms of Service Agreement*
i see that there is a check box for terms of service under 'options', that terms of service should probably get checked when signing up for an account, and that should not be an option IMHO.

4- *Marketing OM to Individuals not just 'Causes' or Non-Profits*
we should make sure that when defining 'causes' it does not exclude individuals. we want people who are not a part of a non-profit to want to use ourmedia too. but at the same time discourage youtube-y type crazy media. we want to attract people who are about change in the world. action.

5- *Claim your Internet Archive Accounts*
would love ourmedia to have the ability to display all the content i've uploaded on the Archive. i would have an AMAZING profile, as i have about 600 videos there, never have i been able to display that anywhere. WOW.

6- *Showcase being funky*
under showcase it says:
"/sites/default/files/missing mediaurl
No media found for"

7- *Dashboard and Username link to the same thing*
the ability to edit your profile and look at your stuff in the same place.

8- *User Icons Square Formatted Like Twitter*
that makes users look more uniform and differnciates them from video icons

9-*Stop video Pages from Auto-Playing

10-*choice of formats on Video Pages, Flash, QT etc*

11- *Featured Producers Links Counter-intuitive*
user's icon on the featured producers sidebar should link to the user's profile, right now it links to the featured item which is already linked to and a bit counter intuitive.
