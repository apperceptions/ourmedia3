1- Notifications Need to Empahsis-
example:
    the one that says "Thank you for applying for an account..."
notification should be in *RED* or have a diff. color background, the plain black blends in too much 'The changes have been saved.'

2- Cause Tab in Profile Editing Section Needs Tweaks-
    i think it should be defined fields, like Cause Name:    Cause Link:
    and maybe specify that you can link to outside places? i was a little confused on that
would be a great place to learn about causes people care about.
also we should define 'cause' i automatically think of it as a non-profit, but it could (potentially) be a lot of things. 
also would be cool to have a little sidebar check box option to put your Fav. Causes on your profile sidebar.

3- Terms of Service Agreement
i see that there is a check box for terms of service under 'options', that terms of service should probably get checked when signing up for an account, and that should not be an option IMHO.

4- Marketing OM to Individuals not just 'Causes' or Non-Profits
we should make sure that when defining 'causes' it does not exclude individuals. we want people who are not a part of a non-profit to want to use ourmedia too. but at the same time discourage youtube-y type crazy media. we want to attract people who are about change in the world. action.
