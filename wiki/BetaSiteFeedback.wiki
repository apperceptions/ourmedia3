1- Notifications Need to Empahsis-
example:
    the one that says "Thank you for applying for an account..."
notification should be in *RED* or have a diff. color background, the plain black blends in too much 'The changes have been saved.'

2- Cause Tab in Profile Editing Section Needs Tweaks-
    i think it should be defined fields, like Cause Name:    Cause Link:
    and maybe specify that you can link to outside places? i was a little confused on that
would be a great place to learn about causes people care about.
also we should define 'cause' i automatically think of it as a non-profit, but it could (potentially) be a lot of things.
