#summary Development sandboxes and distributions

== Sample Database ==

Eric's been working on a sample database for the ourmedia beta.  He submitted it to the source tree and I will add one to the downloads when it is ready.  For now, you can grab a copy using: 

svn export http://ourmedia3.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/omdev.sql.gz 

== Custom Modules and Theme ==

Beta versions are now in the [http://code.google.com/p/ourmedia3/source/browse trunk/beta]

== Downloads ==

I just added a zipped version of the sites/all folder to downloads and committed the beta versions of our custom mods and theme to the source code repository under svn/trunk/beta.

See http://code.google.com/p/ourmedia3/downloads/list

== Distribution ==

Ultimately, I would like to create a Drupal distribution profile.
