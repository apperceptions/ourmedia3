#summary Development sandboxes and distributions

== Sample Database ==

Eric's been working on a sample database for the ourmedia beta.  He submitted it to the source tree and I will add one to the downloads when it is ready.  For now, you can grab a copy using: 

svn export http://ourmedia3.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/omdev.sql.gz 

== Custom Modules and Theme ==

Beta versions are now in the [http://code.google.com/p/ourmedia3/source/browse trunk/beta]

== Downloads ==

I just added a zipped version of the sites/all folder to downloads and committed the beta versions of our custom mods and theme to the source code repository under svn/trunk/beta.

See http://code.google.com/p/ourmedia3/downloads/list

== Distribution ==

Ultimately, I would like to create a Drupal distribution profile.

== General Installation Notes ==

You will need to 

# create a mysql database for the ourmedia site (CREATE DATABASE OM)
# download, untar and import the sample database (\. ~/omdev.sql)
# download and untar drupal
# download and untar ourmedia_all.tar.gz
# edit sites/default/settings.php to set db_urls and base_urls

Notes:
# menus and content still reference beta.ourmedia.org
