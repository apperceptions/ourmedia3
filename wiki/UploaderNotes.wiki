draft notes about uploader.  please pardon any misunderstandings, this is early draft based on first use.

  * background: Eric Zimmerman has created an http-based, uploader service for use with archive.org.  Markus has created a Drupal module that integrates that service into Ourmedia.

  * Currently, the service allows anyone to upload a single media file to archive.org.

  * d=dave, e=eric, g=gus, m=markus denotes who comment/question is best directed to.  + denotes higher priority

  * de brand spinxpress uploader or ezuploader?
  * de open source the server side of upload service?
  * dm additional pro services: transcode, distribute to several hosting services, save to archive, public/private sharing of files, download page, ads/revenue, ssl extra?

  * e+ baseurl applied to email
  * e+ how cancel upload?
  * e how recharge for amazon fees?
  * e+ make redirect optional.  email too.
  * e uploads to flickr, youtube and blip?
  * e what is the cost of this service?
  * e how check status of upload if not immediately transfered to archive.org?
