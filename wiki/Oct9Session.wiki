  * *Add ability to search by media type* - would be great if you could restrict an Ourmedia search to only video, or only audio instead of just "Media" and "Image"

  * *Add "your search returned X results" to search results page* - just so you know how much you have to go through, or that you should refine your search

  * *migrate old content?* - some video & audio from my search was available on the older Ourmedia site but not newer - is the older content going to be migrated? *let me know if you need an example URL*

  * *fix date format* - some of my finds (from searching) showed date of Dec. 31 1969 - somethng wrong with date format

  * *check file formats?* - example, found [http://beta.ourmedia.org/node/18612 this] via search but can't play file, follow [http://www.archive.org/details.php?identifier=Raised_Voices_Torinho_on_indigenous_peoples Download Original File] link to Internet Archive, can't play there, follow Resources > [http://ourmedia.org/node/18612  Item at Ourmedia.org] link to old Ourmedia site and the file will play
  * *clarify Channel Talk* - on channels page, under the player at the top of a channel page, there's a "Channel Talk" area - is there a way to make it clear that's a group blog written by channel participants? I was confused about what it was since it also contained media
